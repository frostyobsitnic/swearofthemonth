The Swear of the Month Club was founded in March of 2015 by [Cory O'Brien](http://coryob.com), creator of [Myths RETOLD](http://bettermyths.com). He did it out of the goodness of his heart, a lifelong love of swearing, and a desire for internet money.

Originally, subscribers received one or two neologisms per month, but the club gradually transformed into a linguistic soapbox from which to deliver authoritative pronouncements on the finer points of applied swearology.

In mid-2018, Cory decided it was a shame to keep all this cutting edge swear research locked up behind a paywall, and so this site was born. Here you will find the last years' worth of articles, free of charge. If you want the rest ... well, they're archived on [Patreon](http://patreon.com/bettermyths).
