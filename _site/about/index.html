  <!-- <h1 class="page-title">About</h1> -->
  <p>The Swear of the Month Club was founded in March of 2015 by <a href="http://coryob.com">Cory O’Brien</a>, creator of <a href="http://bettermyths.com">Myths RETOLD</a>. He did it out of the goodness of his heart, a lifelong love of swearing, and a desire for internet money.</p>

<p>Originally, subscribers received one or two neologisms per month, but the club gradually transformed into a linguistic soapbox from which to deliver authoritative pronouncements on the finer points of applied swearology.</p>

<p>In mid-2018, Cory decided it was a shame to keep all this cutting edge swear research locked up behind a paywall, and so this site was born. Here you will find the last years’ worth of articles, free of charge. If you want the rest … well, they’re archived on <a href="http://patreon.com/bettermyths">Patreon</a>.</p>

<p>You can follow Cory <a href="http://twitter.com/bettermyths">here</a>, or email him <a href="mailto:cory@swearofthemonth.club">here</a>.</p>
